(TODO: add an actual mockup)

Reader screen:
- 2 layers:
  - Book text layer: bottom layer, always visible
  - Control elements layer: top layer, touch toggles visibility

---
Book text layer:
- Only scroll mode is available in the first iteration
- Chapter title centred and with larger font size
- Subparts title left aligned, with some styling
- First paragraph of each chapter starts with a dropped capital
- (maybe) Show special symbol on the right to indicate that there is popular or many comments to this paragraph (or any comments at the early stage)
- (later) Page number in gray on the left
- (action) touch anywhere toggle control elements layer's visibility
(TODO: define context menu related stuff)
